List of exercises on reduce() function.

Pythonâ€™s reduce() is a built-in function that performs computation on all the elements
in an iterable (such as array, list, etc.) and returns a single computed value.

Syntax:
reduce(function, iterable, [initializer])

Parameters:
    function: Required. The function to execute for each item. Function must have one parameter.
    iterable: Required. An object that represents a series, collection, or iterator. Accepts many iterables.
    initializer: Optional. It's placed before the items of the iterable, and serves as a default
                 when the iterable is empty.
